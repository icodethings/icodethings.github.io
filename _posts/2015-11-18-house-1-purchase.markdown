This is the first post in the adventures of my first house.

On a Friday evening at the start of August 2015 we inspected a 2 bedroom unit in [Murrumbeena](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Murrumbeena+VIC+3163/).
The same suburb I've lived in my entire life. My partner and I had been looking and bid (and lost) at a few auctions for
a few months for our first home. We loved the unit, it was the perfect location, perfect size, it had huge north facing
windows and just what we were after. Required a bit of work, but we were up for the challenge. The next day we put in an 
offer and that night the offer was accepted. They didn't even get to taking photos of the unit before we had our offer 
accepted. Easiest sale ever!

The house was built in the 1980's so it has some fun features like carpet throughout, yellow walls, super cool lighting
and a slightly outdated kitchen.

When we first inspected the house we saw a lot of potential in knocking out the wall between the kitchen and the living
area and replacing the kitchen. Lucky for us my dad is an architect and project manager for [Spectrum Interiors](http://spectrumaust.com.au).
He was very happy for us and so excited that he had already drawn up plans a few days later.

We have a few things we are going to get done before moving in:

 * Knock down wall between kitchen and living room
 * Replace carpet with laminate flooring
 * Replace all the kitchen
 * Replace the wardrobe in the master bedroom
 * Replace the switch board, outlets and as much wiring that makes sense
 * Replace all the ugly lighting with LED down-lights
 * Create a point-to-point wifi network between the unit and my parents house
 * Build a software controlled lighting system (smart home)
 
Pretty straight forward stuff and with my awesome dad helping out, it should be pretty easy.

I'm planing on building a custom 'smart home' system for the house. And the only real reason is because I've always
wanted to. At the start it will simply control each LED down-light both on a device (phone) or via networked light
switches around the house. I have dubbed the system 'Wilson' and I have plans to expand the functionality of it in the
future.

I will be writing follow up posts about both the renovations and Wilson.
